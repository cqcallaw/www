My cinnamon raisin oatmeal [method](/blog/cinnamon-raisin-oatmeal/) has evolved, inspired by [social media](https://x.com/anthonyshock/status/1873433917199614379).

1. 1/2 cup [Bob's Red Mill Quick Cooking Steel Cut Oats](https://www.bobsredmill.com/quick-cooking-steel-cut-oats.html)
2. 1 tablespoon [cinnamon sugar](https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-to-make-cinnamon-sugar-3060767)
3. 2 tablespoons raisins
4. 1 1/2 cup water
5. 1 oz salted butter

Mix oatmeal, cinnamon sugar, and raisins. [Toast](https://commongrains.com/how-to-toast-oats/) over medium-high heat. Add water and bring to a boil. Cook over low heat for 7 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent stickage. [Whip](https://x.com/anthonyshock/status/1873433971293356540) butter into the oatmeal and serve.
