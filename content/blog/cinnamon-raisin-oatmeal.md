For me, cinnamon raisin oatmeal is the addition of cinnamon, sugar, and raisins to a basic oatmeal recipe. For oatmeal recipes that call for boiling water, I like to boil the water together with cinnamon sugar, so my oatmeal is cooked in what is effectively a light cinnamon simple syrup.

The details of the recipe will depend on the type of oats used, but I've had good success with the following:

1. 1/2 water
2. 2 tablespoons [cinnamon sugar](https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-to-make-cinnamon-sugar-3060767)
3. 1/4 cup [Bob's Red Mill Quick Cooking Steel Cut Oats](https://www.bobsredmill.com/quick-cooking-steel-cut-oats.html)
4. 1 tablespoon flaxseed
5. 2 tablespoons raisins

Mix the water and cinnamon sugar together and bring to a boil. Add remaining ingredients and cook on medium-low heat for 5 minutes or until the desired consistency is reached.
