I love passwords. If I sprinkle in a few special characters, passwords can be aspirations, affirmations, mediations, or prayers. A favorite silly movie quote. Dreams for the future. The moment I fell in love. Something nobile, pure, or true.

I don't use a password manager. I want the continual reminder that eventually becomes muscle memory. IT-mandated password rotations are wonderful; they force me to keep my focus points fresh.

For real security, I enable [multi-factor authentication](https://www.nist.gov/itl/tig/back-basics-multi-factor-authentication)--but make sure it [isn't SMS](https://www.wired.com/2016/06/hey-stop-using-texts-two-factor-authentication/). For fun and profit, I keep typing my own ["correct horse battery staple"](https://www.xkcd.com/936/)
