This post builds on the basic information in [my previous cold brew post](https://www.brainvitamins.net/blog/cold-brew-at-home-2/) with more recipes and preparation ideas.

# With Cream and Sugar
* 2 oz. cold brew concentrate
* 6 oz. water
* 1/2 oz. simple syrup
* 1/2 oz. heavy or whipping cream

For a hot beverage, heat everything except the cream to about 160° F, then add the cream and enjoy. For a cold beverage, mix everything together with ice.

## Extra Creamy
For an extra creamy cup, substitute unsweetened almond milk for water in the "Cream and Sugar" recipe. I don't enjoy the flavor of hot almond milk, so I prefer to put this variant on ice.

# Caffe Latte
The essential structure of the drink is cold brew concentrate (replacing the espresso shot in a traditional latte), sweetener, flavorings, and frothed milk. These ratios work well for me:

* 2 oz. cold brew concentrate
* One of the following flavor options:
    * 1/2 oz. simple syrup with 1/2 teaspoon vanilla or hazelnut extract
    * -OR- 1/2 oz. flavored syrup (e.g. Torani or Monin)
* 6 oz. frothed milk

Any milk that can be frothed should work. Cow's milk is a classic; almond milk also works well for cold beverages. If the almond milk contains sweetener, reduce the added sweetener as necessary. I highly recommend the [Breville Milk Cafe](https://www.breville.com/us/en/products/coffee/bmf600.html) for frothing milk; the cheap, hand-held whisks are too messy, and steamer wands are usually attached to bulky espresso machines.

For a hot beverage, heat everything except the milk in the microwave for about 45 seconds; I aim for just over 160° F, measured with a temperature gun. Froth the milk, then pour the frothed milk into the flavored hot coffee concentrate.

For a cold beverage, skip the heating step and add ice at the end.

## Blended Caffe Latte
With the Milk Cafe, one can froth the cold brew and flavorings together with the milk; the result is a light, coffee-flavored milk froth that can be enjoyed hot or cold. One could probably get a similar effect with a blender.
