[No money can buy you a better Coke](https://kottke.org/10/10/andy-warhol-on-coca-cola), but I'm convinced the best corn tortillas are fresh off the griddle at home. Two ingredients ([masa harina](https://recipes.howstuffworks.com/what-is-masa-harina.htm) and water), 1 minute cook time, and I am quite addicted.

Fresh tortillas are delicious plain or spread with butter. Sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top of the butter for a sweet snack; cheese melted and mixed with refried beans makes a heartier filling.

I've heard that day-old tortillas are fed to the pigs in Mexico, and I believe it; the flavor fades fast. Not recommended for leftovers.
