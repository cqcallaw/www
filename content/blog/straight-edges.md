My [shelter-in-place](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/) impulse buy was a straight razor kit. I'm still learning how to shave comfortably, but the shaves are quite smooth. Now that the initial anxiety about cutting myself has faded, the process is a lot of fun. 

The Art of Manliness [guide](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-straight-razor-shave/) is a good intro, to which I'd add the following notes:
* As long as I'm reasonably careful, cuts aren't nearly as painful as I expected them to be.
* Make sure to understand the correct angle; 30 degrees is probably closer than is strictly comfortable at first. If you experience a lot of discomfort but don't cut yourself, the angle is probably wrong; the razor is likely tugging at your hair instead of slicing it.
* Use the lightest touch possible; for me, it helps to think of the razor as just barely kissing the skin.
* I've read elsewhere that shaving against the grain isn't advisable if you have curly facial hair.
* Developing left-hand dexterity for hard-to-reach spots is well worth it.
* You haven't really lived until you've shaved your bikini zone with a straight edge.
