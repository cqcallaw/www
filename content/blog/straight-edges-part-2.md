I continue to enjoy [shaving with a straigh edge razor](https://www.brainvitamins.net/blog/straight-edges/). A few additional discoveries:

* A sharp razor can shave arm hair without lather or discomfort. If the razor pulls on the hair or fails to cut it, it's time to sharpen the razor.
* Make sure to use the sharpening tools properly (read the instructions). I tend to use too little water on my waterstone; it should be nicely soaked
* Shaving against the grain hasn't triggered ingrowth of hair for me (though my hair isn't very curly).
* Proper illumination can really help when searching for missed patches.
* [Proraso After Shave Lotion](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0085UECY2/) is excellent.
