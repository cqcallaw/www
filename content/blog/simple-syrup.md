Simple syrup is equal parts sugar and water, brought to rolling boil. The basic recipe is a staple of mixed beverages, and affords endless variations. Some of my favorites are listed below.

## Basic Recipe

* 1/2 cup water
* 1/2 cup white sugar

Combine ingredients and bring to a boil on the stove. Let boil for about 30 seconds. Cool and refrigerate. The mixture is generally said to stay fresh for 4-6 weeks.

## Vanilla Cinnamon Simple Syrup

* 2 cups water
* 2 cups white sugar
* 1 dried vanilla bean
* 8 cinnamon sticks

Combine water and sugar in a saucepan. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise, then scrap the seeds into the sugar water. Cut the vanilla bean in quarters and add to the mixture. Add cinnamon sticks. Bring to a boil as above.

Strain the bean and cinnamon sticks from the mixture; the vanilla seeds may be left in for flavor. Cool and refrigerate as above.

## Honey Vanilla Cinnamon Simple Syrup

Substitute honey for sugar in the recipe above. All proportions remain the same.
