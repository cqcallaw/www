It is perhaps inevitable that I discovered sourdough baking. It's been a pleasant adventure in dough (but also doughy waistlines!)

# Starter

I worked from https://www.theclevercarrot.com/2019/03/beginner-sourdough-starter-recipe/ and after a month or so of false starts, my starter is healthy and active. Some notes:

* Temperature is quite important. I didn't see much activity until I began monitoring the room temperature at which the burgeoning starter was kept. The starter responded well to warmth generated by the computers in my home office.
* Ratios are important. I had much better success using a kitchen scale after trying to "eyeball" it.
* Feed starter when it has _any_ stink. The odor can vary even with the same starter. Mild and slightly yeasty smell is fine.
* The starter seems to need air, at least for the first bit.
    * exposing more of the starter's surface area to air seems to be helpful, so increasing the starter's size isn't always profitable if the starter's in a jar.
    * bowls seem to be better than jars.
    * stirring the starter half way through a 24 hour cycle helps a lot.
* This method for refreshing the starter works well: https://www.pantrymama.com/5-ways-to-strengthen-a-sourdough-starter-give-your-starter-a-boost/
* Cutting the starter in half seems to help ramp up the activity slowly.

## Feeding Strategy

Feeding requires some planning so enough starter is available without generating enormous amounts of un-used discard. Once the starter is established, here is one method for baking a small daily loaf of bread (an excellent way to gain experience with the bread baking method):

* Build up the starter using the standard discard half, then feed the remainder with 1:1:1 ratio of starter, flour, water.
* Once one has a little more than 225g of starter, there's enough for a loaf of bread. So:
    * 75g goes to bread
    * 75g is feed 1:1:1
    * 20g is discarded

My starter seems most active at 12 hours, but definitely needs feeding after 24. So:
    * at hour 0, do 50g 1:1:1 feeding
    * at hour 12, do 75 1:1:1 feeding
    * at hour 24, use 75g of starter for bread, and 50g to feed the next round

# My Bread Method

Derived from https://www.theclevercarrot.com/2014/01/sourdough-bread-a-beginners-guide/#sourdough-starter

* 75g active starter, 100% hydration (can double this for a larger loaf)
* 12g olive oil
* 120g water
* 250g all-purpose flour
* 4g salt

Mix starter, oil, and water. Add flour and salt. Mix loosely, just until all the flour is incorporated. Let the dough rest for 30 to 60 minutes (autolyse). Stretch and fold every half hour for 2.5 to 3 hours. Bulk rise for 2 to 3 hours, depending on ambient temperature. Form dough into a boule, and cold proof for 12-36 hours in the refrigerator.

To bake, preheat oven to 450 degrees Farenheit. Line a Dutch oven with parchment paper and place the loaf on the paper. Reduce temperature to 400 degrees and place the Dutch oven with cover into the oven. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove cover. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees and bake for 35-50 minutes.

To avoid gumminess, let the loaf rest on a wire rack for an hour before cutting into it.

## Bread Notes

* Wet your hands before working the dough, to keep the dough from sticking to your hands. Don't over-do it, though: you want hands that are damp, not sopping wet.
* Until you know your starter well, make sure the starter passes the float test every time. Starters can regress!
* Baking a loaf longer can help prevent a gummy texture, but will make the crust very hard.
* Fold and stretch on the dough's timetable. Stretch and fold the _before_ the bulk rise, or there will be gummy lines in the dough.
* Don't let the bulk rise go for too long. In my experience, letting the dough rise overnight at room temperature is far too long.
* Bread is best immediately after baking, but keeps fairly well for a day if uncut.


# Other Recipes

* Pancakes: https://www.theclevercarrot.com/2020/05/homemade-fluffy-sourdough-pancakes/
    * Leaving out the baking soda and baking powder will result in much thinner pancakes, but a much stronger sourdough tang that I quite like sometimes.
* Waffles: https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/classic-sourdough-waffles-or-pancakes-recipe
* Pizza dough: https://littlespoonfarm.com/sourdough-pizza-crust-recipe/
    * I sometimes do multiple stretch-and-folds if I feel the ingredients of my dough aren't well-mixed.
    * Cook for 3-5 minutes, broil for ~2 minutes

    * I reduce the salt from 3/4 teaspoon to 1/2 teaspoon
