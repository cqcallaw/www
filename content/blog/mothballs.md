Early in the development of [newt](https://github.com/cqcallaw/newt), two central questions formed that I found useful for focusing my work:

1. Can it be done (that is, can the language be implemented)?
2. Will people use it?

I've done enough work to confidently answer "yes" to the first question. The second question is harder to answer definitively, but the small amount of evidence I have indicates the answer is "no." For this reason, I don't expect newt to get much more of my time or attention.
