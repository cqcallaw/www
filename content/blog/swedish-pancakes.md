I'll spare you the traditional long-winded recipe sales pitch and simply report we've eaten these pancakes with maple syrup almost daily for two months and haven't tired of it. 

For 2 large pancakes:

* 1/2 cup milk
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 cup flour
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon melted butter or vegetable oil
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Combine the milk and eggs first, then add the rest of the ingredients. Blend until very smooth. The mixture will be very runny; the cooked pancakes are very thin.

Cook on a well-greased griddle on medium heat; don't over-cook. Top with any traditional pancake or crepe toppings; maple syrup or blueberry sauce and whipped cream work well.
