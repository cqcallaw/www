Via BoingBoing, I recently encountered an [interesting read](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/07/the-sugar-conspiracy-robert-lustig-john-yudkin) about how the scientific consensus about diet was influenced by decided unscientific means. Ironically, the article is published by an organization that is at least roughly speaking a newspaper, while explicitly mentioning that newspapers have a credibility problem. Informed individuals who would say Yudkin was a fraud may well exist; I suppose that readers will believe whatever they believe.

I personally find the narrative of corruptible science believable, which is why I think it dangerous to categorically dismiss dissenters from any scientific consensus as fools. Deniers of anthropogenic climate change may in fact be Yudkins, however small the probability might be.
