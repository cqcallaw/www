The browser extension I [discussed previously](/blog/distributed-authenticity-for-web3) is now accessible at [on GitHub](https://github.com/cqcallaw/qui). The extension won't (intentionally) leak private data, but constructive criticism and user feedback is welcome.

[Handling signatures in IPLD](https://blog.ceramic.network/how-to-store-signed-and-encrypted-data-on-ipfs/) looks like a better long-term solution, but the use of PGP should be an effective stopgap while standards emerge.
