To access Web3/Dweb content hosted on IPFS:

1. Install [ipfs-desktop](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop#quick-install-shortcuts). This program runs in the background and communicates with the rest of the IPFS swarm to fulfil content requests.
2. Install the [IPFS Companion](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion#install-ipfs-companion) for your browser of choice. The Companion will intercept requests for Web3 resources and translate them into requests to ipfs-desktop.
3. Visit an IPFS Web3 site. My site has a Web3 [version](http://www.brainvitamins.eth), as does [the Ethereum project](http://ethereum.eth/) and [SpaceX](https://spacex.eth/).
