Over the past year, I've experimented extensively with cold brew at home, spending too much on equipment and gadgets. This post is a distillation of my learnings.

# Equipment
I was extremely dissatisfied with the Bruer device that shows up in a lot of search results; clean-up is easy, but setting the drip rate is fussy and repeatable brew results are almost impossible. Instead, I recommend the [OXO cold brew tower](https://www.oxo.com/cold-brew-coffee-maker). $50 is not bank-breaking, and the hassle-free clean up is well worth it.

A kitchen scale is a requirement as well; I'm reasonably satisfied with [OXO's 5-pound scale](https://www.oxo.com/products/preparing/measuring/5lb-food-scale-w-pull-out-display#black), but I find myself wanting a higher precision readout when I'm mixing drinks.

If you want to grind your own beans, a good burr grinder is worth investigating. A medium grind setting seems to work well.

# Coffee Selection
The number of sources, blends, roasts, etc. can be overwhelming; if you don't know what coffee to use, start with a medium roast house blend, then experiment.

# Cold Brew Mocha Recipe

* 1 oz. chocolate syrup (I use and heartily recommend Torani's [Dark Chocolate Sauce](http://shop.torani.com/Dark-Chocolate-Sauce/p/TOR-780001&c=Torani@Sauces))
* .5 oz. heavy whipping cream
* 5.5 oz. 2% milk
* 2 oz. water
* 3 oz. cold brew concentrate

Blend ingredients together thoroughly in a blender, and serve over ice (I use [ice balls](/blog/clear-ice/)).

The quantities might seem strange, but are designed to sum up to 12 oz. The ratios of milk and water can be tweaked to taste, but I find more than 1/2 an ounce of cream makes the drink too rich, and less than 5 oz of milk makes the drink more watery than I like.
