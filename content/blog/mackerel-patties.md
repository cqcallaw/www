* 1 lb. canned mackerel with all the liquid in the can
* About 1/2 cup minced onion (a small onion) or 1 1/2 tsp. onion powder
* 1/3 cup dry bread crumbs
* 2 eggs
* 1 tsp. dry mustard powder
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* Cooking oil for frying

Break the fish into small pieces. Add all the rest of the ingredients and mix well. Form patties. Roll each patty in more bread crumbs to form a coating. Fry in a frying pan in hot oil, about 3-4 minutes per side. Turn carefully to fry the other side.
